## General Info

This portfolio project is designed to showcase and tie together the skills I've been developing over the past few months (Aug '21 - Nov'21). 

When this project is complete the user will be able to view and interact with a properly formatted, responsive and aesthetically pleasing website. 

The website will include some basic information about me, my interests and my skills.

In the future the site will be updated with other completed projects in order to showcase them.

Upon completion this project will overwrite the andrewdelamare.github.io page and be linked to from my bio.
