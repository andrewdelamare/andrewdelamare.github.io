## About me
Hi there! I'm Andrew, an aspiring software developer living in Jyväskylä, Finland. (Add picture of myself)

I was born and raised in California on the San Francisco peninsula and I studied Scotts law and English law at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland. I am now living in Jyväskylä and studying front end development. (add pictures of SF bay, Scotland & Jyväskylä)

In my free time I enjoy cyling, playing music, fermenting, brewing, and spending time with family and friends.

-- in July 2021 I rode 322km from Jyväskylä to Espoo in 19 hours and 36 minutes! -- (add picture of route) -> (cool js effct with a big red sticker saying "All in one day!")

## Technologies and Experience

I began my coding journey at the start of 2021 after moving to Jyväskylä, and since then have worked with a number of languages. My first language was Python, and after learning python syntax I moved on to Swift and Swift UI. I really enjoyed learning Swift, but when it came to building an app with Swift UI I was in way over my head. I then started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript with the CodeCademy [Front End Engineer](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path "Front End Course Catalogue") course.

After completing this website (as a project to demonstrate my current abilities with the above front end technologies) I will continue my CodeCademy course and will learn: React, Redux, TDD, Data Structures & Algorithms. 

Upon completion of my CodeCademy course I intend to study cloud computing with a focus in one of the major cloud providers (haven't decided wich one yet). I also intend to complete the [University of Helsinki Full Stack open course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/ "Full Stack Open 2021").
